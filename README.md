This project is a multiplayer gaming platform developed to explore and learn Golang and real-time WebSocket connections. It combines a robust backend with a responsive frontend to deliver classic games like Pong and Tic-Tac-Toe, playable in real-time with other users.
## Tech Stack:

    - Golang: Backend server and WebSocket management.
    - SQLite: Lightweight database for user data.
    - HTMX: Dynamic front-end templates for a seamless SPA experience.
    - Bulma.css: Modern CSS framework for a clean and responsive design.
    - TypeScript: Enhanced interactivity and maintainable frontend logic.

The primary goal of this project was to learn Golang and experiment with real-time connections like WebSockets.
